## Objective

To create a controlled environment with a SIEM like Splunk for monitoring, analyzing, and correlating security events, enabling the development of custom rules and improving incident response strategies.

## Initial Setup

We will use Splunk Enterprise for the setup, a widely recognized and trusted SIEM platform known for its robust capabilities in security event monitoring and analysis.

***1. Setting up the server for Splunk installation.***
   
- Choose your preferred operating system and follow the respective guide to spin up a machine:
   - For Windows, refer to the W[indows setup guide.](https://github.com/mmhgwyjs/windows-lab)
   - For Linux, refer to the [Linux setup guide](https://github.com/mmhgwyjs/linux-lab).

***2. Downloading the Splunk installer.***

- Create a Splunk account if you donâ€™t already have one.
- Download the appropriate installer package for your operating system from the official Splunk website: [Splunk Enterprise Downloads](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/splunk-enterprise.html).
- For this guide, Red Hat Linux is used as the operating system.
