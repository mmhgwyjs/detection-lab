## Objective

To create a controlled environment with a SIEM like Splunk for monitoring, analyzing, and correlating security events, enabling the development of custom rules and improving incident response strategies.

## Initial Setup

We will use Splunk Enterprise for the setup, a widely recognized and trusted SIEM platform known for its robust capabilities in security event monitoring and analysis.

***1. Setting up the server for Splunk installation.***
   
- Choose your preferred operating system and follow the respective guide to spin up a machine:
   - For Windows, refer to the [Windows setup guide.](https://github.com/mmhgwyjs/windows-lab)
   - For Linux, refer to the [Linux setup guide](https://github.com/mmhgwyjs/linux-lab).

***2. Downloading the Splunk installer.***

- Create a Splunk account if you donâ€™t already have one.
- Download the appropriate installer package for your operating system from the official Splunk website: [Splunk Enterprise Downloads](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/splunk-enterprise.html).
- For this guide, Red Hat Linux is used as the operating system.

***3. Installing Splunk Enterprise.***  

- Use the following command to install Splunk:  
  ```
  sudo rpm -i splunk-9.3.1-0b8d769cb912.x86_64.rpm
  ```

  > Take note of the Splunk web interface link. By default, it is: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
  
***4. Starting Splunk Enterprise.***  

- Change the directory to the Splunk bin folder:  
  ```
  cd /opt/splunk/bin
  ```  
- Run the following command to start Splunk:  
  ```
  sudo ./splunk start
  ```
- During the setup, you will be prompted to set up a username and password. These credentials will be used to log in to the Splunk console.

***5. Logging into the Splunk Enterprise Console.***

- From any machine with a browser that can access your Splunk server, open the web interface link noted earlier: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Addtional Configurations

### Adding Sample Datasets (Boss of the SOC - BOTS Dataset Version 3) - Optional

- Download the dataset from the following link:  
  [BOTS Dataset Version 3](https://github.com/splunk/botsv3?tab=readme-ov-file)  

- Copy the downloaded file to the directory `/opt/splunk/etc/apps/`:  
  ```  
  cp botsv3_data_set.tgz /opt/splunk/etc/apps/
  ```  

- Extract the dataset:  
  ```  
  sudo tar -xvzf /opt/splunk/etc/apps/botsv3_data_set.tgz
  ```
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c98147eb-95ef-4347-bb10-cd3286c3b84f)

- Restart the Splunk service to apply the changes:  
  ```  
  sudo /opt/splunk/bin/splunk restart
  ```  
- In the Splunk console, use the following search query to confirm the logs:  
  ```  
  index=botsv3
  ```
